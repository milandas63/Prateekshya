    =   What is a programming language?
        A language that can communicate with a computer machine, for example
        C, C++, Java, Python, etc.

        Programs are written in form of notations that can be read by human
        users. The machine does'nt understand these notation languages. The machine
        understands machine language only. The machine language is written using
        bits, i.e. 0 and 1. The computer languages in form of human readable form
        must be converted into machine language inorder to be executed by the machine.

        This conversion takes place by a specific tool for the respective language called
        the compiler. Some computer languages does'nt compile the human readable notation
        permanently once for all to the machine language.

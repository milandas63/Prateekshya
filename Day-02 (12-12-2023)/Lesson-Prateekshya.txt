    =   What is a programming language?
        A language that can communicate with a computer machine, for example
        C, C++, Java, Python, etc.

        Programs are written in form of notations that can be read by human
        users. The machine does'nt understand these notation languages. The machine
        understands machine language only. The machine language is written using
        bits, i.e. 0 and 1. The computer languages in form of human readable form
        must be converted into machine language inorder to be executed by the machine.

        This conversion takes place by a specific tool for the respective language called
        the compiler. Some computer languages does'nt compile the human readable notation
        permanently once for all to the machine language.

    =   Syntax of for loop
            The for loop has 2 parts: signature and block: for... {}
            When only one line is required to loop, the block may not be used,
            only the statement/line is provided

            All parameters are optional:
            for(;;) System.out.println("Hello");

            for([initializer]; [condition-checking]; [incrementor]) [{}]
 
            To control the loop behaviour, parameter to the loop are provided
            >   initializer
                This deals with numbers. A variable is initialized with some numeric
                values. When a variable is defined, it is required to also define
                the variable type.

                    int x = 10, y = 0, z = 5;

                    for(int i=0,j=10;;) {}

            >   condition-checking
                This checks and controls the number of iteration to take place.

                    for(int i=0; i<10; ) {}

            >   incrementor

                The 3rd parameter increments/decrements the values in the varables
                defined in the initializer.

    =   The number of operators vary in case of computer programming languages:
        In Java programming language:
            +, -, *, /, %, ++, --, 

            for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {}

    =   Precedence of operators

    =   Features of a computer language are:
        1)  It is executed in sequence of line numbers
        2)  It can loop across one line or a set of lines again and again
        3)  Condition checking
        4)  Computation of equations
        5)  Branching
        6)  Jumping

    =   There are 3 types of computer languages:
        1)  Passive language
            A computer language that does'nt follow the features of a computer language.
            It is used for presentation purpose only. Good looking output is presentation.
            HTML - HyperText Markup Language
            SGML - Standard Generalized Markup Language
        2)  Active language
            An active language is the most common computer programming language.
            It is used for solving critical problems.
            It resides in the local machine or LAN where it is executed.
        3)  Dynamic language
            Programs written in dynamic languages reside in the server machine. When
            requested to execute across the network, it executes using the server
            machine resources and returns the output in form of passive language.

    =   HTML stands for Hyter Text Markup Language
        >   HTML is NOT a case sensitive language.
        >   HTML is a tag based language
        >   Tag is a reserve word that is embedded with angle brackets <>.
        >   There are approximately 100+ reserve words.
        >   Tags are officially known as ELEMENTS.
            <html>, <head>, <body>, <input>, <img>, <table>, .....
        >   Every element may have a set of ATTRIBUTES.
            <html version=''>, 
            <head profile=''>,
            <body background='' bgcolor='' text=''>
        >   There are 2 types of ELEMENTS:
            a)  Terminator required element
                <html>...</html>
                <body>...</body>
                <table>...</table>
            b)  Self-terminated element
                <area>
                <img>
                <br>
                <hr>
        >   Attributes are of 3 types:
            a)  Standard attribute
                That is specifically created for an ELEMENT
            b)  Common attribute
                Those attributes which are applicable to all ELEMENTS
                id, class, style, title, lang,  dir, ...
            c)  Event attribute
                onclick, ondblclick, onmousedown, onmouseup, onmouseover, onmousemove,
                onmouseout, onkeypress, onkeydown, onkeyup
        >   The principal element in HTML is <html>...</html>. This element wraps all
            other elements within it.
                <html>
                    <head>
                        <title>Prateekshya</title>
                    </head>
                    <body>
                        <h1>Hello World</h1>
                    </body>
                </html>
        >   HTML is created to run within an internet browser. An internet browser has
            two parts:
                a)  header
                b)  body
        >   The best editor for writting HTML programs is VS-Code.
